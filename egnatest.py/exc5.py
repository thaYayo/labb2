# You now own some property and you want to calculate the total area of the property.

# Create a program that:

# Reads the width and height
# Prints the area
# Example: width = 5, height = 2
# Output: total_area = 10

width = float(input("Enter the width: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height: "))

area = width * height
print(area)
